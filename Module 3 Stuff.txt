MAE (Mean Absolute Error):
	Pros:
		Simple to understand
		In the same units
	Cons:
		Problems with outliers
		Not differentiable
MSE (Mean Squared Error):
	Pros:
		Differentiable
		Find a min/max
		Easy to compare with other models
		Weights Errors
	Cons:
		Not the same units as the data
		Very sensitive to outliers
		Weights Errors
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):
	Pros:
		Original units
	Cons:
		Sensitive to outliers
		More complex (ie. Big O time)
RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error):
	Pros:
		Really good with a big range of numbers (ie. small to very large numbers)
		Can handle outliers better (little)
		Can over punish overestimations
	Cons:
		Not compatible with negative numbers
		More complex (ie. Big O time)
		Can over punish overestimations
R^2
	Pros:
		Domain knowledge is not needed (ie. saying a house is off by $180k depending on the value of the house, like $3M+ then who cares, but if less then stress. This is domain knowledge)
	Cons:
		Difficult to explain
